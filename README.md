# ME 351 - Fluid Mechanics Project

_The ME 351 Teaching Staff is seeking project proposals for the design and construction of a fresh water supply main so that E5 can have direct
access to the refreshing waters of Lake Ontario. A narrow corridor of land along a 62.5 km long route from E5 to Lake Ontario has been purchased.
Your teamâ€™s goal is to design a cost-effective water main system and summarize your analysis in a short report._

This is a python script that finds the cheapest pipeline given elevation profiles, road crossings, railway crossings, and water crossings and outputs pump stations and pressure data.

# Setup
